Postal Plus Demo
================

Postal Plus Demo is very similar to Postal Plus, except that it only
comes with a single level and does not include the editor or
multiplayer support.

Multiplayer was dropped from the demo because it was considiered highly
unlikely that someone downloading this new demo (created in June 2001)
will be able to find anyone else to play against.  And multiplayer has
traditionally been difficult to test because of all the different versions
of the game already out there.  And we didn't want to spend a lot of time
on putting together this demo.  Put it all together, and you get why
we dropped it.


Separate Assets
---------------

The demo uses separate \res and \sak folders along with its own set of
\make files.  This is necessary because the full game's .sak files are
too big for a downloadable demo.  The demo's .sak files are smaller
because they only include the files the demo actually uses.

The root folder for the demo is \PostalPlus\Demo.


Changes from Postal Plus
------------------------

Copied "Postal Plus.dsp" to "Postal Plus Demo.dsp".  Renamed all
cases of "Postal Plus" to "Postal Plus Demo" (except for
"Postal Plus.ico", which will work fine for the demo.)

Add Postal Plus Demo.dsp to the workspace.

Copied "Postal Plus.ini" to "Postal Plus Demo.ini".  Changed network
path to point at demo's root folder.

Created new "res\levels\Postal Plus Demo realms.ini" that includes
just one single-player level and one gauntlet level.

Cleaned up a bunch of macros in CompileSettings.h and added a few
new ones.  This changes applies to Postal Plus, too, but it shouldn't
effect anything in that product.
